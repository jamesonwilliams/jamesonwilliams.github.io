I made my first static webpage in 1997 or so. Let me set the scene:
Netscape Navigator, Alta Vista, Yahoo!, Geocities, cgi-bin, raw FTP, Ken
Burns' HTML Goodies. Ribbons supporting net neutrality, strikethrough
font. The good old days.

Around 2001, I started hosting my own website on an old Debian box,
running off a Comcast line in my bedroom closet. With a LAMP stack at my
disposal, I got invested in Wordpress and would build my my own themes.

I continued doing front-end design work until college, when I built a
few simple sites as a paid developer. I found that academic pages tended
to have simple, minimalist look and feel.

Over the next 5-10 years, I didn't really do a lot on the web.
JavaScript became the tool of mode, and inumerable frameworks emerged.

Fast forward to today: __I'm back, baby!__ Static hosting on GitHub
pages. Markdown, HTML, CSS. No funny business. I love how things have
come full circle.
